# LJ Code 201 Day 17

Highlights of what I learned today:

- We are in project week, so I thought we were done with daily learning journals. Humph!
- I've provided project related info on the 'quizes' for that purpose, so I'm not talking about that here.
- It's been a positive experience and our project team is great.
