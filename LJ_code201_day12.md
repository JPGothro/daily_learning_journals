# LJ Code 201 Day 12

Highlights of what I learned today:

- Adding the chart to the page was cool. Talking with other students on how they handled things was interesting. It was good to get different perspectives/solutions to our common problems. I felt pretty good about what I accomplished; even the odd behaviors of JS.

- Looking forward to our project week, but still wondering how we will deal with a short week...
