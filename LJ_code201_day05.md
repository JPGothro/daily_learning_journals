# LJ Code 201 Day 5

Highlights of what I learned today:

- Git and GitHub: We went over publishing on GitHub; possibly a bit quickly for me to feel confident about it, but I'll give it a shot. When it comes to 'regular' branching, I feel pretty good about that process. As always, more practice will help (with the new stuff in particular).
- I got a little bored with the JS tasks and raced ahead a bit, so did not create as many branches as required for the assignment. But I feel comfortable enough with the number of them I did to feel like I can do it as needed.
