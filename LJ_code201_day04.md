# LJ Code 201 Day 4

Highlights of what I learned today:

- Git and GitHub: Forking, branching and merging and pull requests today. I feel like I'm starting to understand these processes better. Again, more practice will help!
- Pair Programming: this was a great exercise! I enjoyed the challenge of explaining where I wanted to head and what each of the steps were to get there. Tom was great to work with as he was very good at communicating. Not just directions, but his understanding, questions and roadblocks. I hope we were able to get through it so he is as pleased with his code changes as I am.
- I think my preemptive seat selection is aiding my goal of World Domination! Mwahahaha!
