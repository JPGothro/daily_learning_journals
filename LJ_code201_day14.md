# LJ Code 201 Day 14

Highlights of what I learned today:

- The animation stuff whizzed right past me: I need to do the readings for it, and Aaron sprinted through it in class. Had I done the reading, likely I would have caught more of it. :-P

- Project stuff, including how we are to handle Git/GitHub - a bit tricky, but our team will just have to communicate well about it.
