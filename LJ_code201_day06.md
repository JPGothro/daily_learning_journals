# LJ Code 201 Day 6

Highlights of what I learned today:

- Git and GitHub: more practice with branching and A-C-P. Cool.

- I lived with the minor annoyance of not using object constructors, knowing it was a temporary situation. :)  

- There was great help/assistance from the Instructor and TA's today. THANK MY LUCKY STARS!
