# LJ Code 201 Day 2

Highlights of what I learned today:
- Git and GitHub: this is where I feel I've learned the most and have a ways to go to understand it all. All the basic steps are easy enough to understand, but some of today's new concepts/actions had some sticking points for me. When creating a new branch, is Git simply creating a diff file somewhere to track changes? I understand that no new directories or copies of files are generated, but I'm not yet understanding what's happening.
- HTML and CSS: Those seem to be progressing on pace. Even if I'm no star designer, I can get things where I want them and looking like I want. For the most part. :)
- Still looking to have more interaction with the other students...
