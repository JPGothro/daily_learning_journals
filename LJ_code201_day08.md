# LJ Code 201 Day 8

Highlights of what I learned today:

- The assignment this week is a good challenge. I get to work on JS and still have time to attack the CSS. I've certainly learned more of that and find the trial and error method works to figure things out.

- I've not been keeping up with the reading as I've been working on my outside course. I'm trying to get that behind me. Apologies.
