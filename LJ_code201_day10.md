# LJ Code 201 Day 10

Highlights of what I learned today:

- Working as a team today helped to a small degree in terms of my CSS phobia. I hope that reading through the text book and working more on it will help my confidence.

- The review of Styling was helpful to me during class, but that's the information that seems to fly past me to quickly.
