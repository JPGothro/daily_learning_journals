# LJ Code 201 Day 1

Highlights of what I learned today:
- Canvas: has assignments and is required to complete them.
- Git and GitHub: this was interesting and I'm looking forward to more on this.
- IDE's: aren't generally used, replaced with an editor and deployment environment with dev tools (google Chrome).
- Hopefully, I'll have more interaction with the other students...
