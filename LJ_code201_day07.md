# LJ Code 201 Day 7

Highlights of what I learned today:

- Got to use object constructors! :)  I also enjoyed working with the DOM in the code. It such a cool thing to do. Making sure I'm not making typos so the code runs is also a positive step.

- I was able to get the CSS to do some things I intended! :-P  I feel like I gained some traction (or friction!) with the styling.
