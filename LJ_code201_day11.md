# LJ Code 201 Day 11

Highlights of what I learned today:

- The project was very straight-forward in the HTML and CSS requirements (for today's portion of work). The JS was not too complicated, as well. I felt pretty good about what I accomplished.
- Not so pleasant was the extra long presentation at lunch. It seemed more focused toward the 401 class and ran very long - longer than we were led to expect. It should have been either held in the 401 room or after the class day. The content of the presentation was good, but not as a surprise chunk out of our lab time. Also, why don't we hear about these ahead of time?
