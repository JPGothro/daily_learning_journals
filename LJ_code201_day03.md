# LJ Code 201 Day 3

Highlights of what I learned today:
- CSS: spent quite a bit of time 'fiddling' with this on my about_me project, trying to force things to work how I wanted them to. Eventually, I got to a simpler version that worked pretty well. Phew! Still feels like a long way to go to get a decent handle on this CSS "stuff".
- HTML and JavaScript: These went pretty well today, although, in the lab, I didn't get to all the stretch goals I would have liked to.
- Git and GitHub: We went over branching and merging today. Going through it led me to understand it more better. :)
More practice with this will help with it all.
- Had more interaction with the other students and TA's! Sweet!
