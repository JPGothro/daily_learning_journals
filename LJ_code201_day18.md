# LJ Code 201 Day 18

Highlights of what I learned today:

- I was trying to help Will with a problem he ran into. He eventually talked to Aaron and found that he had assigned a string array to a function, wiping it out as a function and it had become a variable. All because of a single equal sign! Interesting!!
- It's been a positive experience and our project team is great.
